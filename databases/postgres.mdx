## Overview

Zanode provides managed PostgreSQL databases running in the same South African data center as your application. Zero latency between your app and database.

## Create a database

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to your project">
    Navigate to your project in the dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Databases">
    Select the **Databases** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create database">
    Click **Create Database** and choose a name.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your database is ready within seconds.

## Connection string

Once created, your connection string is automatically added to your environment variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/database
```

<Info>
  The connection string is encrypted at rest and only available to your application.
</Info>

## Connecting from your app

### Node.js (pg)

```javascript
import pg from 'pg';

const pool = new pg.Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL
});

const result = await pool.query('SELECT NOW()');
```

### Prisma

```javascript
// prisma/schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

### Drizzle

```javascript
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/postgres-js';
import postgres from 'postgres';

const client = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
export const db = drizzle(client);
```

## Backups

Databases are backed up automatically. Contact support to restore from a backup.

<Warning>
  Restoring a backup replaces all current data. This cannot be undone.
