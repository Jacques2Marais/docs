## Overview

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security when signing in. After entering your password, you'll need to verify your identity using an authenticator app or email code.

## Enable 2FA

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Security Settings">
    Click your profile → **Account Settings** → **Security** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Enable 2FA">
    Enter your password to confirm.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scan QR Code">
    Open your authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.) and scan the QR code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Verification Code">
    Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Backup Codes">
    Store the backup codes in a safe place. You'll need them if you lose access to your authenticator.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Each backup code can only be used once. Store them securely.
</Warning>

## Signing In with 2FA

When 2FA is enabled, you'll see an additional verification step after entering your password:

1. **Authenticator App** — Enter the 6-digit code from your app
2. **Email Code** — Click "send code via email" to receive a code
3. **Backup Code** — Use one of your saved backup codes

    Click your profile → **Account Settings** → **Security** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Disable 2FA">
    Enter your password to confirm.
