## Overview

Zanode auto-detects build settings for most frameworks, but you can customize them in your project's **Settings** tab under **Build Configuration**.

## Build command

The command used to build your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

**Common examples:**

| Framework | Build command |
|-----------|---------------|
| Next.js | `npm run build` |
| Vite | `npm run build` |
| Astro | `npm run build` |
| Create React App | `npm run build` |

## Start command

The command used to start your app after building:

```bash
npm start
```

**Common examples:**

| Framework | Start command |
|-----------|---------------|
| Next.js | `npm start` |
| Express | `node server.js` |
| Fastify | `npm start` |

<Note>
  For static sites, no start command is needed — files are served directly.
</Note>

## Output directory

Where your build artifacts are located:

| Framework | Output directory |
|-----------|------------------|
| Next.js | `.next` |
| Vite | `dist` |
| Astro | `dist` |
| Create React App | `build` |

## Node.js version

Zanode uses Node.js 20 by default. You can specify a version in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "20.x"
  }
}
```

## Build environment variables

Environment variables are available during the build process. Common use cases:

- API keys for CMS or backends
- Build-time configuration
- Feature flags

See [Environment variables](/environment-variables) for more details.
